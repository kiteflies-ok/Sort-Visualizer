An interactive, friendly visualizer, sorting an array of elements through the following sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort

All we do is select any sorting algorithm of our choice out of these seven sorting algorithms and navigate through the following features:
1. Start Magic! ✨ : This will start sorting the unsorted array

2. Pause/Resume Magic! 🔀 : This will pause the visualization on first click and and click it again to resume the animation

3. Reset : This is for reseting the array to an unsorted one and begins a new cycle of sorting it.

4. Previous ⏮️: This will move the previous steps to let to follow its path in it past. (therefore not letting you miss any steps behind!)

5. Next ⏭️: This will move to steps next to the present step of sorting the bars.

6. Speedometer (the blue guy in below the logo!): Lets you control the speed of the animation of bars in the visualizer.




~ There is the visualizer panel on the left of the screen with array elements(numbers) over the pink bars which will animate after starting an unsorted array.

~ On the right side of the screen is the Code Panel is displayed which shows the codes of the sorting algorithm that is selected.

~ Lastly it tracks and displays which array element (numbers) are getting sorted and for what reason!

Thank you, have a great day!

Made with human efforts and peace... hehe
